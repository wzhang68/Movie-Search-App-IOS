# Movie-Search-App-IOS
This mobile app is an extended version of Movie-Search-Web in my repository. This app is a native SwiftUI application, which allows users to view some of the trending Movies and TV shows, search for movies and TV shows of their choice and view their details. There’s also a watchlist where users can save, remove and track the TV shows and movies they’d like to watch later.<br>
The App contains 3 screens: Home, Details and Search and Watchlist.<br>
My backend is written in Node.js, and it is host on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).<br>
